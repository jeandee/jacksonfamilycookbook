# Congee

Base recipe ['Congee (Chinese Rice Porridge, 粥)'](https://redhousespice.com/congee/) by Wei Guo from Red House Spice. I chose this recipe one evening because I wanted one with simple ingredients and without the fanfare.

## Overview

Congee (or the Filipino equivalent, _lugaw_), is my ultimate comfort food. It's the one dish I look for when I'm very sick, and when I was pregnant, on my first trimester, when even the thought of a sip of water made me shudder.

I thought that 36 is too old to not know how to make congee at home. I was certain it wasn't as complicated as some recipes make it out to be. It's also annoyingly difficult to find a bowl of congee when ordering in.

## Ingredients

_Serves three_

### For the congee
- 1 cup (250 mL) white rice
- 9 cups (1.75 L) chicken stock*
- knob of ginger, julienned

### Toppings
- boiled egg
- soy sauce
- sesame oil
- toasted garlic
- scallions
- fried wonton chips
- black pepper, ideally freshly ground

## Steps

1. Wash the rice as you would if you were making steamed rice, to your satisfaction. Drain and set aside.
2. Bring the stock to a boil, then add the rice.
3. Wait for the mixture to boil once more. Then, turn the heat to lowest.
4. Simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
5. Turn off the heat.
6. Serve into bowls. If serving to other people, let them leisurely add their desired toppings buffet-style.


## Notes

* In countries like Australia, chicken stock can be bought liquid, in a carton. I just make stock from powder or bouillon cubes.
* Cooking the ginger in is what gives the congee its distinct _lugaw_ flavour.
